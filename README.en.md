This is a landing page project for a horror game, developed with HTML and CSS. The landing page is designed to attract players and create a spooky atmosphere that reflects the game's theme and experience.

## Project Structure
The design structure of the horror game landing page is as follows:


    ├── .vscode/
  
    │   ├── settings.json
  
    ├── css/
  
    │   ├── style.css
  
    ├── img/
  
    │   ├── image.png
  
    ├── index.html
  
    └── README.md



 The `css/` folder contains the `style.css` file, where the style rules for the page are defined.
  
The img/ folder stores the images used on the landing page, such as the spooky background (`image.jpg`).
  
The `index.html` file is the main page of the landing page, where all the content and structure are defined.
  
This `README.md` file is documentation to provide information about the project.
